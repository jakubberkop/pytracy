# pytracy

## Installation 

Download the pytracy package using the following command:
`pip install pytracy`

To connect to a profiled application, you will need the Tracy profiler. Follow the steps below:

Download Tracy profiler from [Tracy Github](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases/tag/v0.10). 
- For Windows, an executable is provided by the author.
- For Linux, you need to build it from the source (refer to the documentation for build instructions).
- Use the provided script for Ubuntu to install dependencies and build the Tracy Profiler - scripts\build_tracy_ubuntu.sh

## Usage
1. Enable the profiler
```(python)
import pytracy
pytracy.enable_tracing(True)
```
2. Start your script
3. Start Tracy profiler and click connect

## Limitations:
- Relatively high overhead. Enabling PyTracy currently average ~380ns per function call, compared to ~80ns for an untraced function call. The theoretical limit is an overhead of ~250ns per function call. This has been measured by giving the python profiler an empty function as a profiler callback.
- set_tracing_mode doesn't work for already started threads. It has to be called before other threads are started.
- No visibility into functions run using multiprocessing.
